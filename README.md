# Keras Deep Learning Basics

Implementation of forward and backward calculation of CNN and RNN.

## Note

Both TensorFlow and PyTorch support auto gradient calculation, so it is not necessary to write backward calculation code in practice. The code serves as a reference to understand the gradient calculation, and may help analyse the convergence and research on pruning of deep learning network.

This is the solution to the assignment of a master-level deep learning introductory course in NUS.
